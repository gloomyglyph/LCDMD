# Python Implementation of LCDMD

## This project implements the concepts and algorithms described in the article “Local community detection algorithm based on local modularity density
” ([Article Link]) using Python.

## Features
    1. Implements core algorithms from the article.
    2. Provides clear and concise code with comments.
    3. Includes strike graph example demonstrating usage.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <>
   ```

## Usage
### Do the things below just like the strike_etst.py file which includes a complete step by step usage of this project
1. make a list implementation of your graph
2. make an LCDMD instance for executing the article's algorithms
3. given a node, find the core area and its extended community using the LCDMD instance
4. make the true communities list for validation
5. use f1 score for measurement
